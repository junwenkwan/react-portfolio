                    <p>&emsp; Hi, my name is Jun Kwan and I am passionate about technology. As an individual with strong interests in computer architecture, software and machine learning, I studied Electrical and Computer Systems Engineering (ECSE) at Monash University. Upon my graduation in Jan 2021, I intended to pursue a career in software engineering because I would love to create and design an innovative software product. During my free time, I enjoy reading and playing video games.</p>
